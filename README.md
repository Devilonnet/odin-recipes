# odin-recipes
just some test html page form the odin project
This is the first actual project that i will built with html.
I think that the html part is gonna be just fine, because i have already mastered the basic foundation of html.
The git part is a bit tricky with commitements and i still have to work on that, but i think that i am going to manage to pull this of.
